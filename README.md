# BoW3D
BoW3D is developed for the real-time loop closing in 3D LiDAR SLAM. It builds the bag of words for the **LinK3D Feature**[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.05927.pdf), which is our previous work. is able to detect loops and correct the full 6-DoF loop relative pose in real time. We provide example to run BoW3D on the [KITTI dataset](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php).
